			<p>
			    Windhoek, the capital of¬†Namibia, is located
			    in a basin between the Khomas Highland, Auas
			    and Eros Mountains. It is 1,680m above sea
			    level, 650km north of the Orange River and
			    360km from the Atlantic sea. Whether due to
			    pure luck or a brilliant stroke of Germanic
			    planning, the city is situated in almost the
			    countries epicentre. This location has
			    obvious benefits when it comes to governing a
			    country the size of Namibia, and also makes
			    it the ideal place to start and plan any
			    Namibian travel.<br>
			    The majority of tourists visiting¬†Namibia
			    start their adventure in the capital as it
			    is the main entry point to the country.<br>
			    In 2013 the population of Windhoek was approximately 342,000 people, an extremely small capital by global standards. This number is growing rapidly at present mostly due to a lack of employment in rural areas. Despite the large increase in population over the last few years the city centre is extremely clean, and mostly trouble free. Most tourists comment on the cleanliness of the city, and often pronounce it to be a most un-African city (a somewhat back-handed compliment).
			</p>
		    </div>
		</div>

		<div class="columns">
		    <div class="column col-6">
			<p>
			    The city centre is characterized by a proliferation of¬†German style buildings, a lasting reminder of Namibia's early colonial history. Early buildings such as the1890s Alte Feste (Old Fort),¬†the sandstone Lutheran Christi‚Äôs Church, the Tintenpalast (seat of Namibia‚Äôs government), and the Parliament Gardens are of particular interest. Just west, past leafy Zoo Park, the Post Street Mall shopping walkway has a meteorite display. North is the Owela Museum of natural history and ethnography. The nearby National Art Gallery of Namibia showcases works by local artists. The Trans Namib Museum, in Windhoek Railway Station, explores the country‚Äôs transport history. Northwest is the diverse Katutura suburb, with its markets and local taverns known as shebeens. Further west, Daan Viljoen Game Reserve is home to kudu antelope, zebras and rich birdlife.
			</p>

			<p>
			    In a wonderful display of irony, the Alte Feste Fort, once the bastion of German colonialism, now houses the National Museum which places particular emphasis on the freedom struggle and Namibian independence.
			</p>

			<p>
			    Windhoek has had several names, many inspired by the hot water springs found in the area, the earliest of which were the Damara /Ais //Gams (/ indicates a click in Nama spelling) which means firewater and the Herero Otjimuise or place of steam. The area was also called Queen Adelaide's Baths for a (mercifully) brief time. Several opinions are offered for the origin of the present name, the most popular of these is that sometime before 1840¬†Jonker Afrikaner, a Nama leader, named the area Winterhoek, after the farm in South Africa where he was born. Windhoek, or windy corner, is a corruption of this name.
			</p>

			<p>
			    During the day the city centre has a European cafe culture, German cuisine dominates, but Namibian influence can be found in the quantity and quality of meat on offer. Saying that, the streets are choc-a-bloc with people of all ages and cultures, all bearing a wonderful sense of pride, hope and ambition.
			</p>

			<p>
			    Nightlife in the city centre has grown with the population, with a decent amount of restaurants, bars and night clubs.
			</p>

			<p>
			    Most importantly Windhoek is home to Namibia's brewing industry, and for the less active Windhoek is a great place to while away the time while sipping (or gulping) a cold beer. There are also a number of private hospitals, a state run hospital, and doctor‚Äôs surgeries, banks, (with 24 hr ATM's) pharmacies, supermarkets, bakeries, and clothes shops. There is a large(ish) shopping mall at Maerua Mall, (complete with indoor swimming pool and gymnasium) and a smaller one on Post Street Mall, (Town Square) and at Wernhill Park, all worth a visit, especially if you've had enough of looking at curios. Windhoek's (and Namibia's) sense of progress since Independence, is emphasized by the presence of new offices, combined with expanding and bustling building and commerce industries.

			    The Combination Drive offered by the Bagatelle Kalahari Game Ranch is a game drive, cheetah feeding, and sundowner on the dunes. The game drive is in a reserve where guests can see a variety
			    of game such as giraffe, kudu, zebra, oryx, blue wildebeest, eland and much more. The reserve has some of the highest dunes in the region with views over the pan, characteristic to the Kalahari. The Kalahari has more than 150 species of birds. The well-known suricate (meerkat) is also to be seen, although they are very scarce. Cheetah feeding allows guests the opportunity to come up close to the cheetah and offers a great opportunity for taking photos. The guides will provide guests with interesting facts about this incredible cat and the history of the cheetahs in the game ranches care. After this, a sundowner on the dune will await guests, with refreshments and a Namibian snack, while guests can enjoy a breathtaking sunset in the Kalahari.

			    As there is no accommodation at Sossusvlei, visitors to this desert wilderness are likely to end up staying at Sesriem, 65 kilometres away, where camps and lodges serve as a base from which to explore the dunes. Sesriem Canyon, a deep chasm carved through the rocks by water, is a striking natural feature of the area that is best explored on foot. Stony walls rise up sharply on both sides of the canyon, while birds roost in its crags and lizards dart along the ledges. The canyon‚Äôs name was coined when early settlers used it as a water source, using six lengths of leather (‚Äòses riem ‚Äì six thongs) tied together to lower buckets into the water at the base of canyon.)

			    Sossusvlei is where you will find the iconic red sand dunes of the Namib. The clear blue skies contrast with the giant red sand dunes to make this one of the natural wonders of Africa and a photographer‚Äôs heaven. Aside from the attractions at Sossusvlei - Dune 45, Hiddenvlei, Big Daddy and Deadvlei - other attractions in the area include the Sesriem Canyon and Namib-Naukluft National Park, where the mountains of the Namib meet its plains.

			    Germany‚Äôs North Sea and Baltic coasts transplanted onto African soil. But the city is also thoroughly African and its multidimensional appeal means that most people end up staying longer than they planned.<br>
			    Palm-lined streets, seaside promenades, fine accommodation, a pleasant summer climate and decent beaches. During the summer holidays and long weekends, thousands of Namibians flock to the coast, and this human migration happens for a number of reasons; Swakopmund has a real holiday feel to it and everyone wants to be there; during the December holidays, the cool Namibian coast offers relief from the intense heat of the interior; and more importantly as far as the tourist is concerned in these modern times, Swakopmund has changed, and has become the country‚Äôs leading adrenaline destination, with a wide range of activities to suit all ages.<br>
			    The area of¬†Namib Desert¬†around Swakopmund is named the West Coast Recreational Area and recreation is the towns number one draw card. There are countless pursuits to help you spend your time, and money. For those interested in adventure activities Swakopmund offers sandboarding, quad biking, dune carting, parachuting, hot air ballooning, shark fishing, deep sea fishing and beach angling to name but a few. For the more sedentary there are restaurants, cafes, art galleries, the¬†Swakopmund Museum, a snake park and aquarium.

			<p>
			    Buildings and monuments of note in Swakopmund include the¬†Hohenzollern Building, the¬†Marine memorial, the War memorial in memory of those killed in World War 2, Princess Rupprecht House originally a military hospital now a private guest house, the Kaserne buildings that originally served as a barracks and is of a similar design to the Alte Feste in¬†Windhoek¬†and¬†Fort Namutoni¬†in¬†Etosha. The old¬†Swakopmund Prison¬†is still fully operational and provides budget accommodation for the criminal fraternity of the Namibian coast.
			</p>

			<p>
			    The Swakopmund Railway station was completed in 1901 and now houses the¬†Swakopmund Hotel, while the bells of the¬†Deutsche Evangelical Church¬†were imported from Germany. Standing close to the State House (Kaiserliches Bezirksgericht) is the Swakopmund Lighthouse at just over 20 meters it has been functional since 1902.
			</p>

			<p>
			    The main beach area is called the Mole, and is the result of a largely unsuccessful attempt to construct the artificial harbour (as South Africa owned the only natural harbour in the area at Walvis Bay). The town‚Äôs most iconic symbol is the Swakopmund jetty, initially used as mooring for ships it later became a popular are for anglers and walkers, it has fallen into disrepair on numerous occasions and has been subject to several attempts to rescue it from complete dereliction. Recently large scale work has been completed on the jetty which now proudly boasts a small restaurant and bar area.
			</p>

			<p>
			    True to its German traditions early mornings and evenings in Swakopmund can be cold throughout the year, as the cold Atlantic Ocean meeting the Namib Desert creates a fog bank. This coolness is often a relief from the heat of the rest of Namibia, but does mean that Swakopmund is not the tropical sunbathing mecca that most people imagine.

			<h3 class="my-2">Overnight: Strand Hotel Swakopmund </h3>
			<p>With its extensive, unique and creatively entertaining Restaurants, Bars, Deli, Lobby-Lounge, Sea Facing Terraces, Beach Kiosk and state of the art Conference & Banqueting Center, all set on the Mole, a historic and iconic site surrounded by Ocean on three sides, the Strand Hotel Swakopmund is a social epicenter and destination in itself for all visitors to and residents of Swakopmund. Its architectural inspiration finds its roots deep in Namibian German history and reflects this in a tasteful contemporary manner. The interiors are residential in nature, and the brief to all designers involved was to create a non-hotel, hotel. One as charming and welcoming as the town it is located in. Simply very warm and comfortable, and as they say in German: ‚Äúgem√ºtlich‚Äù providing a genuine ‚Äúsense-of-place‚Äù atmosphere adding to any Namibian visit. Arriving at the Strand is a dramatic experience as one passes through its 13m high and 9m wide Ocean View Atrium which travels right through the Hotel offering sea views at either end. Off this Atrium Lobby is Reception, consisting of three individual desks and an inviting open fireplace which rounds off the residential feel and warm welcome.</p>

Sustainable eco-tourism and community upliftment is of the utmost importance at Mowani. Guides from the local tribes compliment day-time game drives to track mountain zebra, kudu, springbok, klipspringer and if you are fortunate enough... the leopard! The adventurer in me took over at Mowani. Days were filled with game drives, hot air balloon trips over the Aba-Huab Valley, champagne breakfasts and al fresco meals amidst the dusky landscape beneath Mopani trees.</p>

			    The Etosha National Park is Namibia's premiere game viewing experience, situated in the northwest of Namibia and is an area well known for its wildlife. Vegetation ranges from dense bush to open plains attracting a diversity of wildlife. In the heart of the Park is The Etosha Pan - a shallow depression that covers an area of 5000sq kilometres. Dry and shimmering for most of the year, the pans fill up with water after good rains to a depth which is seldom deeper than 1m. In the dry season wildlife is attracted to perennial springs and waterholes that makes for excellent game viewing. Within the park are three large public rest camps catering for the more budget orientated traveller. There are several smaller establishments on the outskirts of the park on private land offering a more intimate and comprehensive experience. All of these establishments offer excellent value for money.
